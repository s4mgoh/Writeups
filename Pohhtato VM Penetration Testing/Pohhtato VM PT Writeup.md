# Pohhtato Virtual Machine (VM) Penetration Testing (PT)

Credits to my seniors at Custodio Technologies who created the VM (Charles & W.L.)

_Note: This is my first time, bare with me please._

I will be using Kali Linux on VMware Workstation Pro as my Virtualization Software.

## Step 1
Ensuring that my Kali Linux (Attacking Machine) & the Pohhtato VM (Target Machine) are on the same network.

## Step 2
Powering on Pohhtato VM shows us that it is using Debian, and two user accounts are available for usage, **cabbage** & **potato-helpdesk**.

**Cyber Kill Chain = Reconnaissance --> Weaponization --> Delivery --> Exploitation --> Installation --> Command & Control (C2) --> Actions on Objectives**

While I won't be implementing all the steps in the Cyber Kill Chain, I will be following the general flow which leads us to **RECONNAISSANCE**.
